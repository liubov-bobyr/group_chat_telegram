**Telegram chat analysis**

I've been thinking about it for a while - I can analyse everything I can/want, even frindship, support and memes. For the first step I've downloaded the whole history of the group chat from Telegram in JSON format, convert it to CSV, prepare some of the data to a workable format and check it. 

You can download the whole notebook, delete my conclusions and just insert your file (I did't rename rows, so i should be fine).
